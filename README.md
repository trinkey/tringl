# TriNGL
it's like ngl but i made it

## how to use
1. download the files or `git clone` the repository
2. create a file in the same folder as this file named `secret_file.py`
3. inside it, put the following code:
```py
str1 = "random text"
str2 = "more random text"
```
(you can make the text anything, although changing it will likely (99.999% chance) prevent any current accounts from being able to log in)

4. run the `_server.py` file (make sure you have all the right python libraries aka flask)

## todo list
- make it so i actually like this program instead of putting like 25% effort into it
- embeds
- add captcha variable time settings
- add captcha to posting messages
- push notifications
